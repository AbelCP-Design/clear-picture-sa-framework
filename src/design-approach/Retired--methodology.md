    <h1 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Methodology</h1>
    <p>A transparent, practical evaluation of how well industrial platforms can implement <strong>SA Concepts</strong> — tested visual strategies that support human awareness in real-time operations — and how those concepts combine into <strong>SA Design Patterns</strong> that guide complete dashboard strategies.</p>

  <h3 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Evaluation Process</h3>

  Clear Picture testing follows a repeatable 3-step process for SA Concepts:

  1. <strong>Concept Definition</strong>:  
     Each SA Concept begins with a clearly defined user problem — grounded in a real operational need. The visualization approach is framed to support specific cognitive goals (e.g., faster detection, better comprehension).

  <div style="height:10px;"></div>

  2. <strong>Platform Testing</strong>:  
     The concept is built inside each platform using typical integrator tools and workflows — no unfair custom coding unless clearly noted. This simulates what a real user team could reasonably build.

  <div style="height:10px;"></div>

  3. <strong>Result Documentation</strong>:  
     Results are published with screenshots, configuration notes, and observations. This shows not just whether the concept is possible, but how it behaves and what tradeoffs are involved.

  <p style="margin-top:15px;"><em>SA Design Patterns</em> are not tested across every platform. Instead, they are demonstrated in <strong>FrameworX</strong> to illustrate how multiple concepts can be combined into flexible, goal-driven dashboards. This distinction keeps the framework neutral while still showing practical, high-level examples.</p>

  <h3 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">What the Evaluation Measures</h3>

  This effort focuses on platform <strong>capability</strong> — not visual polish or layout preference. The key question is:

  <div style="margin-top: 10px; font-style: italic;">Can this platform express the concept needed to support user awareness?</div>

  We’re not judging any specific dashboard’s aesthetics. Instead, we’re exploring whether the <em>tool itself</em> can support high-performance, human-centered visualization when used well.

  As new features and platforms emerge, the framework will continue to evolve.
