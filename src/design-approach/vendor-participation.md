# Vendor Participation & Feedback

Clear Picture evaluations are designed to explore how industrial visualization platforms support key Situation Awareness (SA) Design Principles that assist operators, engineers, and decision makers.

Our evaluations:

- Focus on practical implementation of SA Design Principles.
- Use standard, generally available platform features accessible to integrators, designers, and end-users.
- Do not represent formal certification or full mastery of every vendorâ€™s development environment.

We fully recognize that platforms continue to evolve, and that multiple configuration pathways may exist to achieve SA principles.

We welcome vendor participation and ongoing dialogue.

Vendors are invited to:

- Review existing evaluations.
- Share alternative configuration approaches.
- Demonstrate additional SA Principle implementations.
- Submit updated capability information as platform features expand.

Our aim is to maintain an open, neutral, and collaborative resource that supports vendors, integrators, and the wider industrial visualization community.
