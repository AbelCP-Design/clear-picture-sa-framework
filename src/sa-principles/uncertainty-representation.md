# Uncertainty Representation

Displays should clearly communicate the level of certainty associated with process data and conditions.

Visual design techniques may include:

- Confidence bands
- Fading or transparency to indicate aging data
- Status indicators showing data quality

Clear communication of uncertainty supports better decisions under changing conditions.

*(Testing evaluations for this principle are currently in preparation.)*
