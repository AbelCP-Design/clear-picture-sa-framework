# Information Timeliness

Information Timeliness addresses the question:  
**"How current is this information I'm seeing?"**

In real-time monitoring, data that is outdated may lead to incorrect decisions or delayed responses. The goal of this principle is to help industrial users (such as operators, process engineers, or managers) immediately recognize how fresh or stale each piece of information is.

By embedding time-related visual cues directly into displays, users can:

- Detect stale data at a glance.
- Avoid acting on outdated or missing information.
- Prioritize attention where recent updates are lacking.

## Example Concept

- Elements fade to lower opacity when data becomes stale (e.g. no update for 5 minutes).
- A fresh update restores full visibility.
- This approach reduces unnecessary blinking or flashing.
- Provides subtle but effective awareness of data aging.
