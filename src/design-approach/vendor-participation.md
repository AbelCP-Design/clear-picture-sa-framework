# Vendor Participation & Feedback

Clear Picture evaluations are designed to assess whether industrial visualization platforms can support specific Situation Awareness (SA) Design Principles.

Our evaluations:

- Focus on practical implementation of SA Design Principles.
- Use standard, generally available platform features accessible to integrators, designers, or end-users.
- Do not represent formal software certification or full mastery of each vendorâ€™s development environment.

We recognize that industrial platforms often offer multiple configuration options, advanced development tools, or ongoing feature updates that may affect platform capability over time.

**We welcome vendor participation.**

Vendors are invited to:

- Review our current evaluations.
- Suggest alternative implementation methods.
- Provide demonstrations of how additional SA Design Principles can be supported on their platform.
- Submit updated capability information as new features are released.

Our goal is to maintain an open, transparent, and collaborative resource that benefits both vendors and the wider industrial visualization community.
