# Pattern Recognition

Displays should help users detect meaningful patterns in process data, equipment behavior, and operational trends. 
Effective visual design supports:

- Early detection of process anomalies
- Recognition of recurring operating states
- Quick identification of abnormal conditions

Pattern Recognition enables users to respond earlier and with greater confidence.

*(Testing evaluations for this principle are currently in preparation.)*
