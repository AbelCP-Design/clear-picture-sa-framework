# Methodology

The Clear Picture evaluation approach focuses on whether industrial visualization platforms can support practical implementation of Situation Awareness (SA) Design Principles.

The process follows three main steps:

1. **Design Principle Definition:**  
Each SA Design Principle is defined with clear intent, including the user problem it addresses, the operational context, and the desired user experience.

2. **Platform Capability Testing:**  
The principle is prototyped within each platform, using built-in features or reasonable development approaches available to typical integrators. If a platform requires advanced customization beyond standard features, this is noted.

3. **Documentation & Transparency:**  
Results are published openly, showing which platforms can support which principles. Limitations or workarounds are documented where appropriate. This transparency allows both vendors and users to see not just *whether* a platform can support SA-aligned design, but *how*.

**Important note:**  
This evaluation focuses on platform capability â€” whether a tool provides the technical means to implement each SA Design Principle. It does not evaluate the quality of any specific dashboard implementation, which ultimately depends on the skill and design approach of the integrator or developer.

The framework will evolve as new principles are added and as vendors introduce new features.
