# Introduction

Clear Picture provides a structured design framework for evaluating industrial visualization software based on Situation Awareness (SA) Design Principles.

Many industrial platforms promote technical features, but few evaluate how effectively a tool supports human operators in understanding their process, making timely decisions, and maintaining awareness in real-world scenarios.

Clear Picture serves two goals:  
- To transparently document which platforms support essential SA Design Principles, helping vendors and buyers evaluate software capabilities.
- To provide a clear reference of SA Design Principles that designers and integrators can apply directly in building more effective dashboards.

The outcome is a neutral, evidence-based resource supporting better visualization design across the industrial landscape.
