# About Clear Picture

Clear Picture exists to improve industrial visualization through practical application of Situation Awareness (SA) Design Principles.

Industrial dashboards and monitoring systems are often built with limited guidance on how to support the cognitive needs of the people who rely on them for operational awareness and decision-making. Clear Picture documents and tests design patterns that strengthen Situation Awareness for industrial users.

Clear Picture serves both software vendors and industrial organizations who seek to strengthen their visualization design and decision-making capabilities.
