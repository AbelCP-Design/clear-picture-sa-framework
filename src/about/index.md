  <p>Industrial dashboards and monitoring systems are often built with limited guidance on how to support the cognitive needs of the people who rely on them for operational awareness and decision-making.</p>

  <p>Clear Picture documents and tests design patterns that strengthen Situation Awareness for industrial users.</p>

  <p>Clear Picture serves both software vendors and industrial organizations who seek to strengthen their visualization design and decision-making capabilities.</p>

  <h3>Why This Framework</h3>
  <span style="display:block; height:0.0px;"></span>
  <p>Most industrial dashboard systems weren’t designed to produce visual clarity.  
  They were designed to produce working software.</p>

  <p>Vendors build powerful platforms. Integrators deliver solutions.  
  But the system, as it stands, does not reliably produce interfaces that support operator awareness, safety, and confident decision-making — unless deliberately guided to do so.</p>

  <p>Clear Picture SA exists to realign that outcome.</p>

  <p>We do this by translating human-centered design principles into practical SA Concepts,  
  and documenting what each platform makes possible.  
  This gives vendors, integrators, and end users a shared reference for building well-designed visualizations that go beyond functionality — toward clarity, focus, and real operational awareness.</p>
