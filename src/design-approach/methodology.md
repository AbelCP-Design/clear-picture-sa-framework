    <p>A transparent, practical evaluation of platform capabilities to implement Situation Awareness (SA) Design Principles in industrial visualization software.</p>

  <h3 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Evaluation Process</h3>

  The Clear Picture evaluation process follows three main steps:

  1. **Design Principle Definition:**  
  Each SA Design Principle is defined with clear intent — identifying the user problem, operational context, and desired user experience.
  
  <div style="height:0.0px;"></div>

  2. **Platform Capability Testing:**  
  The principle is prototyped within each platform using built-in features or reasonable development approaches available to typical integrators. If advanced customization is required, this is noted.

  <div style="height:0.0px;"></div>

  3. **Documentation & Transparency:**  
  Results are openly published, showing both the capabilities and any workarounds observed. This allows vendors and users to see not just *whether* a platform can support SA design, but *how*.

  <h3 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">What This Evaluation Measures</h3>

  This evaluation focuses on **platform capability** — whether a tool technically allows an SA Design Principle to be implemented.

  It does not assess the quality of any specific dashboard implementation, which ultimately depends on the skill, experience, and design approach of the developer or integrator.

  The framework will evolve as new principles are added and as vendors release new features.
